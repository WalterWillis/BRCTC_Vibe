Purpose of test: Verify that PiHat code works. Verify that results are as expected.

Result: Success! 

Misc:
After noticing that the jumper on the PiHat was on 5v, rather than 3.3v, the results were as expected.

Code worked on first attempt! (Other than include changes that were required, and command line syntax mistakes)

Code was run for a few arbitrary seconds.
